<h1>
Usage:
</h1>

<p>This is a python script that is parsing the .txt files, generated by the CO2 sensing device. It automatically finds areas of intrest, classifies the measurments as long/short measurments (i.e. transparent or dark covers) performs some cosmetic formating and exports the result in a .xlsx sheet.</p>

<h2>Formating single files:</h2>
<p>Using a command line tool, select the working directory where the <i>parser.py</i> file is stored. Format the file by typing:</p>

<b>.\parser.py 'path_to_source' [--destination path_to_destination] </b>

<p>path_to_source should specify the path to the unformated .txt file that is supposed to be formated. Only files with a .txt extension are accepted. If no path_to_destination is provided, the result is stored at the same location that the source files is stored; the name is kept consistent, except for the extension that is changed from .txt to .xlsx. If path_to_destination is given the result file is stored under the given path, provided that the new filnemae has an .xlsx extension. </p>

<h2>Formating batches of files:</h2>
<p>All the data that is supposed to be formated needs to be stored in a single directory. Using a command line tool, select the working directory where the <i>parser.py</i> file is stored. Format the files by typing:</p>

<b>.\parser.py 'path_to_directory' [--destination path_to_destination] </b>

<p>path_to_directory should specify the path to the directory holding the unformated .txt files that are supposed to be fomated. All the resulting files are storedin the path_to_destination directory, if provided. The files are name does not change, but they get an .xlsx extension. </p>

<h2>Testing wether all necessary libraries are installed.</h2>

<p>All testing file is provided, that checks that all necessary libraries are installed. To run the test, select the directory where the testing file is stored and type:</p>

<b>.\test.py </b>

<p> If there are libraries missing, you can install them for example by using anaconda.</p>
